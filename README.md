# dbcourse
A repository to share the material I have prepared for a course about database systems. The course is in portuguese (pt-BR).

If you want to verify the signature of the files you must use the following key:

untrusted comment: signify public key
RWQg+h+bHKHZqg2mIKxcxhZJPcpuL3N66pmERnOKaRrOVF4gjhT8SpNw

The signaure is generated using the signify tool (present in OpenBSD). There is a port for linux in https://github.com/Blitznote/signify . You can also install the signify tool in Ubuntu using the package manager; the name of the package is signify-openbsd. The public key (jefecomp.pub) is published in the repository root.
