# dbcourse
A repository to share the material I have prepared for a course about database systems. The course is in portuguese (pt-BR).

If you want to verify the signature of the files you must use the following key:

untrusted comment: jefecomp<jefecomp.offiicial@gmail.com> secret key public key
RWTQZlRUmXlF06F1FWbC03LvjUS2PBJj7SpAb5hEVhllLCKPxd6I+I6e

The signaure is generated using the signify tool (present in OpenBSD). There is a port for linux in https://github.com/Blitznote/signify . You can also install the signify tool in Ubuntu using the package manager; the name of the package is signify-openbsd. The public key (jefecomp.pub) is published in the repository root.
